# LeanCanvas
A tool to evaluate the adoption of new technology.

The LIT Lab Lean Canvas is a one-page brainstorming tool that allows you to develop and describe an idea. We recommend using this tool to confront problems and work through a potential solution.

We recommend reading through the guided Canvas in its entirety before jumping in. 
After familiarizing yourself with the evaluation criteria, the next step is to consider the problem: what is the issue and do you have any existing tools that could solve it? Here, you would also consider which users the process touches: attorneys, staff, clients? 
Then, you describe the proposed solution: its features, implementation, new workflow. Here, you would also consider the alternative solutions. 
Next, you balance the time and cost of maintaining the status quo against the time and cost of training and implementing the new process. 
Afterwards you will want to consider the concerns and ethical implications surrounding your problem and proposed solution. Finally, review the new process's compliance/interactions with relevant statutes and rules. Add any relevant regulations or approvals to the list. 
You may refer to the instructions on the guide canvas as you complete your blank template.

After working through your issue on the Canvas, you may identify a need to research further or, possibly, that your problem can be solved by tweaking your current process and utilizing unused features of the existing available tools. This tool will ultimately serve as a roadmap for a conversation with your business partner or the outline for a formal memo.
